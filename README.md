# Team Generator 2.0

## Description

Team Generator 2.0 is a command-line application that helps you build a team by gathering information about managers, engineers, and interns. The application prompts the user to input details about team members and generates an HTML file showcasing the team's hierarchy.

**Motivation:**
I built this project to streamline the process of creating a team roster. It aims to provide a simple and efficient way for managers to input team member information and generate a visually appealing HTML page.

**Problem it Solves:**
Managers often need a quick way to organize and display information about their team members. Team Generator 2.0 addresses this need by automating the process of collecting and formatting team member data.

**What I Learned:**
While developing Team Generator 2.0, I gained experience in working with Node.js, Inquirer.js for command-line prompts, and modularizing code for better maintainability.
